# asdf-mysql

[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) plugin for [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) version manager.

## WARNING

If you already have a system installation of MySQL or MariaDB, then
you will run into issues. MySQL makes some hardcoded assumptions about config
file locations, and will not play well with a system install.

There is a ```--no-defaults``` flag for commands listed in the command
help, but for some reason, it's an unknown argument.
