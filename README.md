# asdf-mysql

[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) plugin for [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) version manager.

# Thanks

Until recently, `asdf-mysql` relied on the excellent service provided by [MirrorService](https://mirrorservice.org) of
the University of Kent Computing.

In August of 2022, Oracle removed its `rsync` service for MySQL, though, making the
community edition of the server that much harder to retrieve programatically.

As a result, `asdf-mysql` has moved to using data sources provided by
the [dbdeployer](https://github.com/datacharmer/dbdeployer) project, which
has what seems like a hand-maintained database of mysql versions and URLs.

Thank you to both projects for making `asdf-mysql` possible.

# WARNING

If you already have a system installation of MySQL or MariaDB, then
you will run into issues. MySQL makes some hardcoded assumptions about config
file locations, and will not play well with a system install.

There is a `--no-defaults` flag for commands listed in the command
help, but for some reason, it's an unknown argument.
